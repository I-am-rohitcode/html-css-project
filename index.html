                        <h5>Kevin Feige helped conceive of a shared media universe of Marvel properties.</h5>
                    </div>
                    <p>Marvel Entertainment began producing its own films independently in 2005 and distributed them through Paramount Pictures. In 2007, Marvel Studios raised funding from a $525 million revolving credit facility with Merrill Lynch. The plan was to release individual films for their main characters and then merge them in a crossover film. In November 2013, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige stated that "in an ideal world" releases each year would include one film based on an existing character and one featuring a new character, saying it is "certainly something to aim for."</p>
                    
                    <p>Feige expanded on this in July 2014, stating that the studio was not "a number cruncher" telling the studio to increase their film output but rather to manage existing franchises. After the titles were revealed in October 2014, Feige said that the studio was firing on all cylinders right now, which made them comfortable for the first time... to increase to three films a year [in 2017 and 2018] instead of just two, without changing their methods.</p>
                    <p>In February 2014, Feige stated that Marvel Studios wants to mimic the "rhythm" that the comic books have developed by having the characters appear in their own films and then come together, much like a big event or crossover series. Avengers films acting as "big, giant linchpins" are seen as a way to teach the general movie-going audience about the notion of the characters existing separately, coming together for specific events, and going away and existing separately in their own worlds again.</p>
                    <p>In April 2016, Feige announced that the universe will move to Phase Four and reflect on the first three phases, with Phase Three being the "deconstruction Phase" of the MCU.</p>
